The most iconic feature of Sossusvlei is the towering Dune 45, a massive sand dune that reaches heights of over 500 feet (150 meters). Climbing to the top of Dune 45 to witness the sunrise is a popular activity, offering breathtaking panoramic views of the desert below as the changing light paints the dunes in various shades of red and orange.",
